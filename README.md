# Next.js 15 App Router Bug Report

3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the unexpected behavior in the browser.

## Expected Behavior

## Solution

The bug was resolved by ensuring that the page component is correctly structured to match the routing logic of the App Router and that data fetching is handled appropriately.
